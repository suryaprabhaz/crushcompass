# 💘 CrushCompass

**CrushCompass** is a premium, AI-styled social experiment that simulates discovering who secretly admires you — without real confessions, logins, or data collection.

It’s designed to feel intelligent, exclusive, and viral, using psychology-driven UX rather than cheap randomness.
